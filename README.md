# pathos-vhlt
Vluzacn HL Tools for the Pathos Engine. This (currently) experimental version of the tools supports Bounce properly, and all the standard features of the tools. Currently it does not support the bump map calculations that come with the tools that ship in the Pathos repository, but I made this quick edit to unblock mappers who are not satisfied with the lack of bounce lighting.
