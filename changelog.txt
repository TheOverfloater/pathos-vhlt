  - More informative messages for discarded light entities.

2024 October 12th:
  - Modify VHLT to now produce Pathos BSP Version 2 files.
  - Add new lumps for ambient, diffuse lightmap data, and light vectors data.

2024 October 14th:
  - This fixes a potential crash inside HLRAD.
  - Add support for smoothing lighting between the faces of different entities.
  - Fix issue with outdoor areas not getting ambient lighting from light_environment entities.
  
2024 October 18th:
  - Several fixes added to HLRAD to properly account for bump data lightmaps/vector map when it comes to coring and empty lightmap reduction.
  
2024 November 3rd:
  - Modified vhlt compile tools to now support lightmap upscaling up to 8x(still needs work).
  - Modified vhlt compile tools to support miniz compression of lightmap data.
  - Improved parameter design for new features in the compile tools.
  
2024 December 1st:
  - Fix for issue with light_spot entities causing dark/corrupted pixels due to lack of capping of ratio variables.
  - Fix for incorrect diffuse lightdata generation with bounce.
  - Fix for crash when compiling into ALDs without bump map data being generated.
 
2024 December 9th:
  - Added changelog.
  - Add .ald file to clean list in ResetTempFiles to avoid issues in the future.
  - Edge pairing across entities will now not happen in fast mode.
  - Improved messages which display info about discarded light entities.
  - Added safeguard against light entities with the "night_" prefix having lightstyles set.
  - Added safeguard so light data size between BSP and ALD, and output to ALD is checked for consistency.
  - Added -noreduce parameter to disable lightdata reduction for multi daystage compiles.
  - Using any kind of nonstandard daystage will now enable -noreduce by default.
